> kotori: Doctor—

> kotori: There's a game I want, and it's available on both Switch and Steam. I can't decide which to buy.

> kotori: What is Steam, anyway?

> scala: Steam is a game distribution platform. I buy pretty much all my PC games there.

> scala: One of its big features is the huge discount sales. Not just 30% off — 50%, even 90% off isn't unusual.

> kotori: 90%? So, like, a game that costs $10 would be $1?

> scala: It happens! Though 90% discounts are usually for really old games, like when the developer puts the original on deep sale before launching a sequel.

> scala: Some publishers have a policy against sales, so it depends on the game.

> kotori: Hmm, which one should I buy...

> scala: Both have their merits.

> scala: With a good PC, even demanding games run smoothly. And mods are a big plus, too.

> scala: That said, the Switch has its own appeal. Playing games while lying around is the best.

> scala: I actually buy some of my favorite games on both platforms.

> kotori: Huh.

> scala: Your games are tied to your account, so even if you switch PCs, you keep all your games. No need to rebuy anything.

> kotori: If Steam goes away, do the games disappear too?

> scala: Well, that's just the nature of platforms. But Steam has been around for over 20 years — it's well established.

> scala: Most games are downloaded locally anyway, so if you keep them offline, you'd still have them. You could even just double-click the executable and play without going through Steam.
