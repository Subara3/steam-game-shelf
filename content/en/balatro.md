> kotori: Hmm, I'm in the mood for something... devious. Doctor, I saw Balatro in a Nintendo Direct and I'm curious — what do you think?

> scala: Devious?

> kotori: I want to make a Five of a Kind!

> scala: Ah, you mean exploiting the game's mechanics to do something cheeky. I get it.

> scala: Yeah, Balatro is great. Really fun.

> kotori: It's a deck-building game where you make poker hands, right?

> scala: That's right. You've got the standard playing cards from 1 to K. Basically, each card scores points equal to its rank, and then multipliers are applied (Aces count as 14).

> scala: As you progress through stages, you can use your earnings to add cards, remove cards, and so on.

> scala: And the Jokers with special effects are where it really shines.

> kotori: Like x4, or x8...

> scala: When you find the right combo between this Joker and that Joker — it feels incredible.

> scala: More Jokers unlock as you progress, and there are all sorts of decks and challenges to enjoy.

> scala: If you like this kind of game, [Slay the Spire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/) is a good pick, or maybe... [Luck Be a Landlord](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1404850/) or [CloverPit](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/).

> scala: By the way, since it involves poker, it got classified as "gambling" and the rating went up. Apparently that caused quite a headache.

> kotori: What? But it's educational!

## About Pet Safety

> kotori: Doctor, what about animals?

> scala: You can assume there aren't any issues. There are cows and lucky cats in the card art, but nothing cruel or graphic.

> scala: (Though the torn-up Joker cards might be a little scary for very young kids.)
