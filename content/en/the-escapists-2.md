> kotori: Doctor! Doctor! Let's break out of prison!

> scala: The Escapists 2, huh.
> What did you even do to get locked up?

> kotori: Hehehe, who knows?

> scala: ...

> scala: The first game was decent, but the second one addresses its shortcomings and feels like a solid improvement — that's my take.

> kotori: Hmm.
> When you start with the sequel of a game like this,
> don't you get so used to the quality-of-life improvements
> that you can't go back to the first one???

> scala: Well, maybe...
> But personally, if you like 2, I think you'd like 1 as well.

> scala: The Escapists 2 is a game where you get to experience life in prison.

> scala: You work out to build strength, study, collect items and craft them together...
> Each item is perfectly legal on its own, but combine them and you might end up with contraband.
> Then you hide it in your desk drawer...

> scala: Fistfights break out, you get requests like "beat up so-and-so" — pretty rough stuff...
> You get thrown in solitary and end up peeling potatoes...

> scala: While prison life is entertaining, the art style keeps everything stylized and cartoony, so it never gets too heavy.

> scala: Even though it's called a "prison break" game, it's not something you can play forever — I'd say it's more of a puzzle than a true escape simulation.

> scala: Overall, since you can't play it forever, my impression is "it's a bit rough around the edges..." — but for the price, it's more than fair.

> scala: There's a part of me that thinks, "If it's fun to goof around in multiplayer, then what more do I need?" That's the kind of game this is.

> scala: The escape methods vary by stage, but once you figure them out, you can rush straight to the end — so it's more fun to play with friends who are at the same pace.
> If you're going to play with someone, ideally you should buy it together at the same time.

> kotori: I'll dig through the walls!

> scala: ...

> scala: Also, there's a Switch version with local play, but honestly, split-screen makes it cramped.
> Too cramped — I'd say local play isn't really suited for this one.

## About Pet Safety

> kotori: Are the dogs safe?

> scala: They're invincible.

> scala: I mean, you can technically fight back, but I'd say it's no exaggeration to call them immortal.

> kotori: Oh dear, how terrifying.
