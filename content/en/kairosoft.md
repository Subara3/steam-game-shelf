> kotori: Ahhh, it's the middle of the night again before I even noticed. Doctor, Kairosoft games are dangerous. They're too dangerous. You shouldn't be playing these on a Sunday night.

> scala: That's Kairosoft for you.

> scala: I've been a fan of Kairosoft since their freeware days. Before I knew it, they'd become an actual company. They went from freeware to mobile games, and now they're a full-fledged game studio.

> kotori: Running a bookstore, drawing manga, making games... those were good times!

> scala: Back in the day, their game-development game was called "Game Dev Story" (the original Japanese title was "Game Hattentojoukoku"). Now it's "Game Dev Story++". Times have changed.

> scala: Every game they make is great fun, but Kairosoft's older titles can sometimes be picked up incredibly cheap in bundle sales.

> scala: That said, Steam will deduct the price of any games you already own from a bundle (as long as they're different games).

> scala: So there's no risk of double-buying. Just pick up whatever title catches your eye.

> scala: Personally, I prefer the fantasy-themed ones over the realistic business sims.

> scala: Also, this is just my personal opinion, but some of the titles that were ported from mobile still retain that mobile game feel — the UI sizing and pacing can feel a bit off. I prefer the ones designed for PC.

> scala: Their style is wonderfully goofy and lighthearted. There's a playful absurdity to everything.

> scala: I mean, their signature secretary character is named "Hiyama Hishoko" — a pun on "hisho" (secretary). That tells you everything.

> scala: These aren't really the kind of games where you create custom characters and lovingly watch over them. (You can to some extent, but the aesthetic is more cute than elegant.)

> scala: My recommendations are "Dungeon Village" and "Burger Bistro Story."

> scala: The new "Demon Castle Story" is sure to be great too.

> kotori: If you like Doraemon, "Doraemon Dorayaki Shop Story" is a great pick!

> scala: Word is that the collab goes beyond surface-level fan service and digs into some really deep-cut references.

> scala: Apparently Kairosoft's CEO is a big fan of manga like Kochikame and Doraemon. Their collaborations are carefully curated, and the attention to detail is surprisingly high. For such a goofy studio.

> scala: They even sell merchandise — it's really cute!

> kotori: Kairo-kun is adorable, isn't he?

> scala: I'm fond of the Hawaiian shirt.
