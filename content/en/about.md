## Character Introductions

A doctor who loves Steam games.
Favorite genre: **indie games**.

Actually not great at action games, but loves grinding through repetitive tasks.
A huge fan of sales... or rather, **never misses a chance to get a good deal**.

Can't handle seeing animals get hurt.

>> kotori
An assistant who loves Steam games.
Favorite genres: **action** and **puzzle** games.
Sometimes plays the same games as the Doctor, sometimes not.

The type who buys games without worrying much about sales.

## About This Site

> kotori: Doctor, what kind of place is this?

> scala: This is a site for showing off my Steam library. Please take your time and look around.

> scala: By the way, I only feature games I like, so the rating system has just two tiers: "Recommended for Everyone" and "Recommended for Enthusiasts."

> kotori: What's the difference?

> scala: I decide based on feel.

> scala: Also, you'll notice icons next to the games in the list. My icon means the Doctor recommends it. Since this is the Doctor's site, most of them are Doctor-recommended.

> kotori: My icon means the assistant recommends it. Since I'm just the assistant, there aren't many...

> scala: We only feature games we've actually played. Though some of them were played on Switch or at the assistant's place. (So they're not necessarily all in my library, as it turns out...)
