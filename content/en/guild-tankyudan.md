> scala: Play Guild Tankyudan.

> kotori: Is it good?

> scala: Play it. Play it right now.

> scala: Please, I'm begging you. Let's play it. Immediately.

> kotori: What kind of game is it?

> scala: It's in the same vein as [Type Help](https://william-rous.itch.io/type-help), [Return of the Obra Dinn](https://store.steampowered.com/app/653530/), or... [DE:Fanastasis](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2882080/).

> kotori: [DE:Fanastasis](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2882080/) is an RPG, so that seems a bit different...

## Deciphering the Guild's Records

> kotori: So you figure out whether guild members are alive or dead, their guild rank, and their class — like warrior, and so on?

> kotori: And even if you don't know the answer, you can just mash buttons until something works... Sounds like your kind of game, Doctor!

> scala: Indeed.

> scala: The difficulty was manageable enough that I could clear it without hints, but I was so desperate to see what came next that I resorted to brute force. Very bad manners on my part.

> scala: And yet, even with that approach, the fun wasn't diminished one bit. That's what makes it impressive.

> scala: The way you piece together information from different angles — there's only one path through, and that's what makes it so satisfying...

> scala: So play through it once, then let's smile knowingly together.

## Helpful Characters

> kotori: Um, Doctor. This is true for [Return of the Obra Dinn](https://store.steampowered.com/app/653530/) too, but...

> scala: What?

> kotori: Characters who trash-talk like "You (nationality) scoundrel!" or who just chatter endlessly about other people — those are the most helpful ones, aren't they?

> scala: Absolutely.

## About Pet Safety

> scala: Oh, by the way — no animals are harmed. People die, but it's all in the records. It is a bit serious, sure, but the descriptions aren't graphic, so it's pretty mild.
