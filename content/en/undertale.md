> kotori: DELTARUNE is exciting, isn't it?

> scala: Watching Toby Fox go wild with plenty of funding is a treat. Also, I want to see just how far you can push RPG Maker.

> scala: Come to think of it, Undertale was a game you recommended to me, wasn't it?

> kotori: You're not great at action games, Doctor. Didn't you lose to PAPYRUS?

> scala: When I hear "bullet hell," I get nervous. But wow, it was good. It was a really good game.

> kotori: Yes! It's my absolute favorite indie game.

> kotori: Did you know, Doctor?

> kotori: That character — even when you deliberately rematch them after defeating them, there are different dialogue lines...

> scala: ...Yeah, the sheer volume of flag management in that game. It's constantly watching you.

> kotori: But Doctor, why isn't this one "Recommended for Everyone"?

> kotori: Is it because some parts are a bit cruel?

> scala: No, no, it's not that. It's more like... I don't think it's the kind of game someone who doesn't usually play RPGs would pick up.

> scala: For example, [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/) — I think even people who mainly play mobile games could appreciate its fun. But Undertale is... quirky.

> kotori: Yeah, it doesn't exactly feel like "RPG 101."

> scala: Exactly. There are a lot of gamer-oriented jokes, so recommending it to literally everyone feels like a stretch. There's context that non-RPG players might not pick up on.

> kotori: Like defeating monsters and grinding for experience points...

> scala: Exactly.

> scala: But being trolled by the game's own systems? That's the best.

> scala: And when a character who attacked you with clear murderous intent ends up becoming your friend — something soft and warm stirs inside you, you know?

> kotori: Oh, Doctor! I have the save data for your favorite PAPYRUS ending variants. Want to see?

> scala: ...You know, Kotori, you're so... healthily pragmatic about these things.

> kotori: You don't want to see?

> scala: No, I do. I'm happy. You can never have too many dialogue variations for your favorite character.

> kotori: Right?

> kotori: Doctor, you even bought the Switch version. Aren't you more hooked than I am?

> kotori: Wait, your play time on the Switch version isn't that much though. One playthrough? Two?

> scala: Yeah... The Switch-exclusive bonus content didn't really click with me.

> kotori: Huh.

> scala: Oh, no — don't get me wrong. It's not that I thought "that's wrong!" or anything. It just didn't click.

> scala: Also, I was really attached to the unofficial fan translation. I had too much love for that version...

> kotori: Fan translation mods are such a blessing.

> scala: ...This is strictly my personal, personal opinion, okay?

> scala: PAPYRUS speaking in vertical text in the official Japanese version is playful but "a bit hard to read" for me. For me, Temmie is "HOI!!!!!!!!" and Napstablook is the type who goes "oh......oh......"

> kotori: Doctor.

> scala: What?

> kotori: You really are... so particular, aren't you?

> scala: Well, not everything in the world can be exactly how you want it.
