> kotori: Doctor, Doctor!

> kotori: That free game you used to love — its sequel showed up on Steam!

> scala: Oh, I know. I backed it on the crowdfunding campaign, after all.

> kotori: Oh, nice.

> kotori: Wait, it's in Early Access?

> scala: Yeah, the main story isn't finished yet.

> kotori: Then maybe I'll wait until Early Access is over?

> scala: Too naive! The main story being incomplete doesn't mean this is some kind of demo, you know.

> kotori: But it *is* incomplete, right?

> scala: Incomplete, and still fun.

## Elin Is Fun Even in Early Access

> kotori: Hmm. But I want to see how the story ends, and I like reaching a good stopping point...

> scala: No, no, no — you don't get it.

> scala: Think about Minecraft. Even if the Ender Dragon hadn't been implemented yet, it would still be fun, right?

> kotori: That's true.

> scala: Or [RimWorld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/). Even without the "escape the planet" mission, it's still fun, isn't it?

> kotori: Hmm. I guess so?

> scala: Listen, Kotori. Elona... Elin... is a terrifying roguelike. Because it has no end.

> kotori: Oh, come on. You're exaggerating.

> scala: No, it's true. There is no concept of "max level."

> kotori: Huh? There are no levels?

> scala: There are. But the leveling system is different — there's no upper limit.

> kotori: What do you mean?

> scala: Take a look at my save data, for example.

> kotori: That's a lot of numbers...

> scala: See the main attributes?

> scala: My Strength is 156 (with bonuses).

> kotori: Is that high? Low?

> scala: Well, it's much higher than when I started, and strong enough for everyday life. But if I wander into a Nefia (dungeon) around floor 80 without preparation, I'll get destroyed. That's roughly where I'm at.

> kotori: I don't really get it.

> scala: And these stats — as you go about your daily life, eating meals, fishing for whales, zoning out playing Elin on a lazy day off — they go up a little. 156 becomes 157.

> kotori: And then?

> scala: You can carry a bit more stuff, and your damage goes up a tiny bit.

> scala: And that balance is just exquisite...

> scala: There's practically no hard cap on your stats, and yet they inch up, little by little.

> scala: And then you find yourself playing Elin again. Oh no...

## About Pet Safety
