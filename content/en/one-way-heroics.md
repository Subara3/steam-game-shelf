> scala: One Way Heroics is a roguelike game where you just keep moving right, right, and more right.

> scala: True to its roguelike nature, it's like those "Mystery Dungeon" games, but the fact that you're always moving right makes it incredibly fun!

> kotori: Wait, Doctor, wasn't One Way Heroics originally a free game?

> scala: Yeah. The Plus version came out on various platforms.

> scala: You could start with the free version, but better controls and extra content make things more enjoyable—that's just how the world works.

> scala: Adults with some spare cash can just go ahead and buy it.

> kotori: There's a Switch version too, right?

> scala: There is, but due to resolution issues, the sides get filled with frames, so I prefer the Steam version.

> scala: Though lying down and playing roguelikes is the best.

> kotori: Just buy a Steam Deck then.

> scala: But those are expensive!

## Again and Again, to the Right

> scala: Strategies that change with each class. Items you pick up. Pretty wide freedom to do whatever comes to mind.

> scala: Ah, I just can't help getting stubborn and playing forever...

> kotori: Oh, Doctor, this is one of those games you like—"not a romance game, but has individual endings," right?

> scala: Yes. That's true. But I don't look at One Way Heroics that way.

> kotori: Really?

> scala: First off, the girls are genuinely cute. With some comedy mixed in, they've got animal ears and princesses covered, and they get suuuuper affectionate.

> scala: The atmosphere is nice too.

> scala: But what about the guys!?

> scala: The mercenary's name is literally "Panty Mieta" (Panties Visible)!?

> kotori: The male characters feel more like companions, I'd say.

> scala: Well, it's frustrating that they're kinda cool though...

> scala: The fairy is a girl too, and a certain character is also a girl, so I think Wolf and I basically have opposite preferences when it comes to attraction.

> scala: The default vibe is "boy adventurer!" with girls as an option, I'd say. (※This is the Doctor's bias.)

> scala: So I have no choice but to aim for the yuri ending with the princess.

> scala: I look at Feather the same way in [Silpheed Saga](https://www.silversecond.com/WolfRPGEditor/Game/SilfadeStory/) too!!

> kotori: What kind of way are you looking at them?

## About the Safety of Cats, Dogs, and Others

> scala: Animals are not safe.

> scala: Wild dogs attack you, and they're basically unavoidable without going way out of your way. Also, you can choose to bring a pet as a starting bonus, but if you're not careful, they die incredibly easily. Pack horses and cattle can join you too, but they die.

> scala: I do a challenge run where I max out my pet's upgrades, and if my pet dies, I voluntarily throw myself into the darkness.

> kotori: What are you even doing???

> scala: There's also a rare wildlife protection organization where defeating them powers you up, so... you know?
