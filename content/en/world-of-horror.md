> kotori: "World of Horror"?!<br>Is it a scary game?

> scala: Oh yes, it's scary.<br>It's a very frightening game inspired by the Cthulhu Mythos.

> kotori: Eek!

> scala: What do you mean, "eek"?<br>Kotori. You mow down zombies on a daily basis.

> kotori: Hehehe.

> kotori: I kinda thought you weren't really into that sort of thing, Doctor...

> scala: That's not true at all.<br>The reason I don't play many zombie-slashing games is simply because I'm terrible at action games.

> scala: This game has no action elements (so far), you see.

> scala: At its core, it's a resource management game with elements of luck, where your main goal is to solve a set number of cases before the world meets its doom.

> kotori: Huh, interesting!

> scala: The event outcomes, required stats, and the branching paths to reach each pattern are all fixed — so the more you play, the more you learn what's coming, which gives you an advantage.

> scala: Plus, unlocking "achievements" gradually opens up new elements, so the difficulty generally decreases over time.

> scala: (Once you get the hang of it, you can cherry-pick your way into getting only the easy cases...)

> kotori: Wait, she looks like a high school girl, but she's... 20 years old??

> scala: Well, there are items like cigarettes and alcohol, so... ahem...

> kotori: There's a thug sneaking onto school grounds, intimidating people and forcing them to join. That's okay?

> scala: Apparently so.

## The Incredible Attention to Japanese Detail

> scala: This is actually a game from an overseas publisher.

> kotori: What?!<br>The translation is so natural, and the atmosphere feels so authentically Japanese — I had no idea!<br>(Well, the text did overflow the boxes sometimes...)

> scala: It really is impressive.

> scala: Names like "Shiokawa," recovering health at a "hot spring"...<br>The nuances are captured so precisely — it's a flawless recreation of "that era" of Japan.

> scala: The school occult boom, the broadband-era PCs —<br>all of it is remarkably well-researched.

> scala: Even the character names feel completely natural.

> kotori: By the way, I was absolutely terrified by the pixelated "Good morning" on the character select screen.<br>I cried. Scary. So scary.

## About Pet Safety

> scala: There are no deliberately cruel or distressing depictions, but animals can become "allies," which means — like any other ally — you can send them charging in, and they can die.<br>Stray dogs also appear as enemies sometimes.<br>That said, I'd say they're treated favorably overall. A dog runs one of the shops, buying dog treats gets you a discount, and there are hidden elements involving... well, you know...
