> scala: Huff... puff...

> kotori: Hah... hah...

> scala: Ugh, I'm exhausted.<br>Exhausted.

> scala: Absolutely wiped out.

> kotori: Really, Doctor?<br>Did you think that hard?

> scala: I did use my brain, but I feel like I spent even more physical energy.<br>How are you still so perky?

> kotori: Come on, Doctor, give us the review!

> scala: Huff...

> scala: Q2 is a physics simulation puzzle game...

> scala: Haah...

> kotori: Each stage gives you a challenge to complete — that's the puzzle!

> kotori: Like "bounce the ball off the wall" or "get the ball out of the bottle" — that sort of thing!

> scala: ...

> kotori: Each character has their own special ability, so you can do all kinds of things...

> kotori: Like throwing a ball really far, for example.<br>It's super fun!

> scala: ...

> kotori: So, why are you so tired again???

> scala: This game can sometimes be brute-forced to a solution.<br>Sometimes. The "sometimes" part is important here...

> kotori: You can just draw something huge, slam it down, and things go boing and you clear it!<br>So fun!

> scala: Personally, I'd recommend multiplayer.<br>It's more fun when everyone's puzzling over it together.

> scala: Plus, having more hands simply makes the difficulty drop dramatically.

> scala: (And yet, amazingly, the game is designed so that even a single ordinary person — one with no special abilities — can clear everything.<br>A terrifying feat of design.)

> scala: However, while one person is drawing, the other can't draw at the same time...

> scala: There are quite a few constraints, or rather, the blast radius of each action is huge.

> scala: I don't think it's great for impatient little kids.

> scala: The content is completely family-friendly,<br>but since drawing over someone else's work can mess things up...

> scala: You can see how "But I wanted to do it MY way!!" arguments could break out.

> kotori: Doctor, Doctor, look! Banana.

## About Pet Safety

> scala: Animals don't really show up.<br>There are some slightly dangerous-sounding professions, but it should be fine.
